\label{m38736*id802341}In this chapter we will explore the states of matter and then look at the kinetic molecular theory. Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid and gas. We will also examine how the kinetic theory of matter helps explain boiling and melting points as well as other properties of matter.\par 

\label{m38736*id324876121}All matter is made up of particles. We can see this when we look at diffusion. \par
\Definition{Diffusion}{Diffusion is the movement of particles from a high concentration to a low concentration.} 
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
Diffusion can be seen as a spreading out of particles resulting in an even distribution of the particles. You can see diffusion when you place a drop of food colouring in water. The colour slowly spreads out through the water. If matter were not made of particles that are constantly moving then we would only see a clump of colour when we put the food colouring in water, as there would be nothing that could move about and mix in with the water.

\par 
\label{m38736*id10987324}\textbf{Diffusion} is a result of the constant thermal motion of particles. In 1828 Robert Brown (and others) observed that pollen grains suspended in water moved about in a rapid, irregular motion. This motion has since become known as \textbf{Brownian motion}. Brownian motion is essentially diffusion of many particles.
\par 
\label{m38736*id48327}Matter exists in one of three states, namely solid, liquid and gas. A solid has a fixed shape and volume. A liquid takes on the shape of the container that it is in. A gas completely fills the container that it is in. Matter can change between these states by either adding heat or removing heat. This is known as a change of state. As we heat an object (e.g. water) it goes from a solid to a liquid to a gas. As we cool an object it goes from a gas to a liquid to a solid.
The changes of state that you should know are:
\label{m38736*id02341}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Melting} \\ 
\Definition{\label{id2412224} Melting point } { \label{m38734*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id276}
The temperature at which a \textsl{solid} changes 
its phase or state to become a \textsl{liquid}. The 
process is called melting. 
 } 
\item \textbf{Freezing} \\
\Definition{Freezing point}{The temperature at which a \textsl{liquid} changes its phase to become a \textsl{solid}. The process is called freezing.}
\item \textbf{Evaporation (or boiling)} \\
Evaporation is the process of going from a liquid to a gas. If we add energy then the process is called boiling.
\Definition{   \label{id2412302} Boiling point } { \label{m38734*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id282}
The temperature at which a \textsl{liquid} changes 
its phase to become a \textsl{gas}. The process is called evaporation} 
\item \textbf{Condensation} is the process of going from gas to liquid.
\item \textbf{Sublimation} is the process of going from a solid to a gas. The reverse process is called deposition.\end{itemize}
\par \label{m38736*eip-957}If we know the melting and boiling point of a substance then we can say what state (solid, liquid or gas) it will be in at any temperature. \par 
The following diagram summarises these processes: \\

\label{m38736*eip-864}\noindent{}\textbf{Discussion and conclusion}\\
Discuss your results with others in your class. What conclusions can you draw? You should find that the temperature of the ice increases until the first drops of liquid appear and then the temperature remains the same, until all the ice is melted. You should also find that when you cool water down from boiling, the temperature remains constant for a while, then starts decreasing.}
\end{f_experiment} 
\par \label{m38736*eip-25}In the above experiment, you investigated the heating and cooling curves of water. We can draw heating and cooling curves for any substance. A heating curve of a substance gives the changes in temperature as we move from a solid to a liquid to a gas. A cooling curve gives the changes in temperature as we move from gas to liquid to solid. An important observation is that as a substance melts or boils, the temperature remains constant until the substance has changed state. This is because all the heat energy goes into breaking or forming the forces between the molecules.  \par 
The following diagram gives an example of what heating and cooling curves look like \par

%             \nopagebreak
      \label{m38730*id308618}The \textbf{kinetic theory of matter} helps us to explain why matter exists in different \textsl{phases} (i.e. solid, liquid and gas), and how matter can change from one phase to the next. The kinetic theory of matter also helps us to understand other properties of matter. It is important to realise that what we will go on to describe is only a \textsl{theory}. It cannot be proved beyond doubt, but the fact that it helps us to explain our observations of changes in phase, and other properties of matter, suggests that it probably is more than just a theory.
\par 
      \label{m38730*id308641}Broadly, the Kinetic Theory of Matter says that:
\par 
      \label{m38730*id308647}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \label{m38730*uid34}\item Matter is made up of \textbf{particles} that are constantly moving.
\label{m38730*uid35}\item All particles have \textbf{energy}. Solid particles have the least amount of energy and gas particles have the greatest amount of energy.
\label{m38730*uid36}\item The \textbf{temperature} of a substance is a measure of the \textsl{average kinetic energy} of the particles.
\label{m38730*uid37}\item A change in \textbf{phase} may occur when the energy of the particles is changed.
\label{m38730*uid38}\item There are \textbf{spaces} between the particles of matter.
\label{m38730*uid39}\item There are \textbf{attractive forces} between particles and these become stronger as the particles move closer together.
\end{itemize}
      \label{m38730*id308767}Table \ref{tab:microscopic:kinetic theory} summarises the characteristics of the particles that are in each phase of matter.\par

Attractive forces between particles & Very strong forces. Solids have a fixed volume. & Weaker forces than in solids, but stronger forces than in gases & Weak forces because of the large distance between particles  \\\hline
Changes in phase & Solids become liquids or gases if their temperature is increased. & A liquid becomes a gas if its temperature is increased. It becomes a solid if its temperature decreases. & In general a gas becomes a liquid or solid when it is cooled.

\label{fig:threephases}
\end{figure}
      \label{m38730*id309053}Taking copper as an example we find that in the solid phase the copper atoms have little energy. They vibrate in fixed positions. The atoms are held closely together in a regular pattern called a \textsl{lattice}. If the copper is heated, the energy of the atoms increases. This means that some of the copper atoms are able to overcome the forces that are holding them together, and they move away from each other to form \textsl{liquid copper}. This is why liquid copper is able to flow, because the atoms are more free to move than when they were in the solid lattice. If the liquid is heated further, it will become a gas. Gas particles have lots of energy and are far away from each other. That is why it is difficult to keep a gas in a specific area! The attractive forces between the particles are very weak. Gas atoms will fill the container they are in. Figure \ref{fig:PhaseChanges} shows the changes in phase that may occur in matter, and the names that describe these processes.\par
