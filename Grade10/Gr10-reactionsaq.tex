            \label{m38720*eip-869}Many reactions in chemistry and all biological reactions (reactions in living systems) take place in water. We say that these reactions take place in aqueous solution. Water has many unique properties and is plentiful on Earth. For these reasons reactions in aqueous solutions occur frequently. In this chapter we will look at some of these reactions in detail. Almost all the reactions that occur in aqueous solutions involve ions. We will look at three main types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions, namely precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions. Before we can learn about the types of reactions, we need to first look at ions in aqueous solutions and electrical conductivity.

      \label{m38720*id335294}Water is seldom pure. Because of the structure of the water molecule, substances can dissolve easily in it. This is very important because if water wasn't able to do this, life would not be able to survive. In rivers and the oceans for example, dissolved oxygen means that organisms (such as fish) are still able to respire (breathe). For plants, dissolved nutrients are also available. In the human body, water is able to carry dissolved substances from one part of the body to another.\par 
      \label{m38720*id335302}Many of the substances that dissolve are \textsl{ionic} and when they dissolve they form ions in solution. We are going to look at how water is able to dissolve ionic compounds, how these ions maintain a balance in the human body, how they affect water hardness and how they cause acid rain.\par

            \subsubsection{ Dissociation in water}
            \nopagebreak
        \label{m38720*id335324}Water is a \textbf{polar molecule} (Figure \ref{fig:hydrosphere:water}). This means that one part of the molecule has a slightly positive charge (positive pole) and the other part has a slightly negative charge (negative pole).\par

        \label{m38720*id335349}It is the polar nature of water that allows ionic compounds to dissolve in it. In the case of sodium chloride ($\mathrm{NaCl}$) for example, the positive sodium ions (${\mathrm{Na}}^{+}$) will be attracted to the negative pole of the water molecule, while the negative chloride ions (${\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$) will be attracted to the positive pole of the water molecule. In the process, the ionic bonds between the sodium and chloride ions are weakened and the water molecules are able to work their way between the individual ions, surrounding them and slowly dissolving the compound. This process is called \textbf{dissociation}. A simplified representation of this is shown in Figure~17.2. We say that dissolution of a substance has occurred when a substance dissociates or dissolves.\par

        \label{m38720*id335421}The dissolution of sodium chloride can be represented by the following equation:\par 
        \label{m38720*uid3241}$\mathrm{NaCl\left(s\right)}\to {\mathrm{Na}}^{+}\mathrm{\left(aq\right)}+{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\mathrm{\left(aq\right)}$

The dissolution of potassium sulphate into potassium and sulphate ions is shown below as another example:\par

        \par 
        \label{m38720*id335781}Remember that \textbf{molecular} substances (e.g. covalent compounds) may also dissolve, but most will not form ions. One example is sugar.\par

\Definition{   \label{id2491081} Water hardness } { \label{m38720*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id358}
        Water hardness is a measure of the mineral content of water. Minerals are substances such as calcite, quartz and mica that occur naturally as a result of geological processes. 
         } 
        \label{m38720*id336408}\textbf{Hard water} is water that has a high mineral content. Water that has a low mineral content is known as \textbf{soft water}. If water has a high mineral content, it usually contains high levels of metal ions, mainly calcium ($\mathrm{Ca}$) and magnesium ($\mathrm{Mg}$). The calcium enters the water from either ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ (limestone or chalk) or from mineral deposits of ${\mathrm{CaSO}}_{4}$. The main source of magnesium is a sedimentary rock called dolomite, ${\mathrm{CaMg\left(CO}}_{3}\mathrm{\right)}{}_{2}$. Hard water may also contain other metals as well as bicarbonates and sulphates.\par 
\label{m38720*notfhsst!!!underscore!!!id362}
\Tip{The simplest way to check whether water is hard or soft is to use the lather/froth test. If the water is very soft, soap will lather more easily when it is rubbed against the skin. With hard water this won't happen. Toothpaste will also not froth well in hard water.}
	\par
        \label{m38720*id336486}A \textbf{water softener} works on the principle of \textbf{ion exchange}. Hard water passes through a media bed, usually made of resin beads that are supersaturated with sodium. As the water passes through the beads, the hardness minerals (e.g. calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to the beads. The sodium that was originally on the beads is released into the water. When the resin becomes saturated with calcium and magnesium, it must be recharged. A salt solution is passed through the resin. The sodium replaces the calcium and magnesium and these ions are released into the waste water and discharged.\par \item \label{m38720*eip-id1164949856187}The acidity of rainwater comes from the natural presence of three substances ($\mathrm{CO}{}_{2}$, $\mathrm{NO}$, and $\mathrm{SO}{}_{2}$) in the lowest layer of the atmosphere. These gases are able to dissolve in water and therefore make rain more acidic than it would otherwise be. Of these gases, carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO}{}_{2}$) has the highest concentration and therefore contributes the most to the natural acidity of rainwater. \par 
\label{m38720*fhsst!!!underscore!!!id5341}
\Definition{   \label{id2491282} Acid rain } { \label{m38720*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id5341}
       Acid rain refers to the deposition of acidic components in rain, snow and dew. Acid rain occurs when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are emitted into the atmosphere, undergo chemical transformations and are absorbed by water droplets in clouds. The droplets then fall to earth as rain, snow, mist, dry dust, hail, or sleet. This increases the acidity of the soil and affects the chemical balance of lakes and streams. 
         } 
\label{m38720*id338300}Although these reactions do take place naturally, human activities can greatly increase the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere, so that rain becomes far more acidic than it would otherwise be. The burning of fossil fuels in industries, vehicles etc is one of the biggest culprits. If the acidity of the rain drops to below 5, it is referred to as \textbf{acid rain}.\par 
        \label{m38720*id338311}Acid rain can have a very damaging effect on the environment. In rivers, dams and lakes, increased acidity can mean that some species of animals and plants will not survive. Acid rain can also degrade soil minerals, producing metal ions that are washed into water systems. Some of these ions may be toxic e.g. ${\mathrm{Al}}^{3+}$. From an economic perspective, altered soil pH can drastically affect agricultural productivity.\par 
        \label{m38720*id338337}Acid rain can also affect buildings and monuments, many of which are made from marble and limestone. A chemical reaction takes place between ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ (limestone) and sulphuric acid to produce aqueous ions which can be easily washed away. The same reaction can occur in the lithosphere where limestone rocks are present e.g. limestone caves can be eroded by acidic rainwater.

            \nopagebreak
      \label{m38720*id338608}\textbf{Conductivity} in aqueous solutions, is a measure of the ability of water to conduct an electric current. The more \textbf{ions} there are in the solution, the higher its conductivity.\par

            \subsubsection{ Electrolytes}
            \nopagebreak
        \label{m38720*id338650}An \textbf{electrolyte} is a material that \textsl{increases} the conductivity of water when dissolved in it. Electrolytes can be further divided into \textbf{strong electrolytes} and \textbf{weak electrolytes}.\par 
\label{m38720*fhsst!!!underscore!!!id641}
\Definition{   \label{id2491564} Electrolyte } { \label{m38720*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id641}
        An electrolyte is a substance that contains free ions and behaves as an electrically conductive medium. Because they generally consist of ions in solution, electrolytes are also known as ionic solutions. 
         } 
        \label{m38720*id338697}\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{\arabic*}. ] 
            \label{m38720*uid53}\item \textbf{Strong electrolytes}
A strong electrolyte is a material that ionises completely when it is dissolved in water:
\label{m38720*id338720}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{AB\; \left(s,\; l,\; g\right)}\to {\mathrm{A}}^{+}\mathrm{\left(aq\right)}+{\mathrm{B}}^{-}\mathrm{\left(aq\right)}\tag{17.3}
      \end{equation}
This is a \textbf{chemical change} because the original compound has been split into its component ions and bonds have been broken. In a strong electrolyte, we say that the \textsl{extent of ionisation} is high. In other words, the original material dissociates completely so that there is a high concentration of ions in the solution. An example is a solution of potassium nitrate:
\label{m38720*id338807}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{KNO}}_{3}\mathrm{\left(s\right)}\to {\mathrm{K}}^{+}\mathrm{\left(aq\right)}+\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}\mathrm{\left(aq\right)}\tag{17.4}
      \end{equation}
    \label{m38720*uid54}\item \textbf{Weak electrolytes}
A weak electrolyte is a material that goes into solution and will be surrounded by water molecules when it is added to water. However, not \textsl{all} of the molecules will dissociate into ions. The \textsl{extent of ionisation} of a weak electrolyte is low and therefore the concentration of ions in the solution is also low.
\label{m38720*id338913}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    AB\left(s,l,g\right)\to AB\left(aq\right)â‡Œ{A}^{+}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)+{B}^{-}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\tag{17.5}
      \end{equation}
The following example shows that in the final solution of a weak electrolyte, some of the original compound \textsl{plus} some dissolved ions are present.
\label{m38720*id339008}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    {C}_{2}{H}_{3}{O}_{2}H\left(l\right)\to {C}_{2}{H}_{3}{O}_{2}Hâ‡Œ{C}_{2}{H}_{3}O_{2}^{-}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)+{H}^{+}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\tag{17.6}
      \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
      \label{m38720*uid55}
            \subsubsection{ Non-electrolytes}
            \nopagebreak
        \label{m38720*id339146}A \textbf{non-electrolyte} is a material that does not increase the conductivity of water when dissolved in it. The substance goes into solution and becomes surrounded by water molecules, so that the molecules of the chemical become separated from each other. However, although the substance does dissolve, it is not changed in any way and no chemical bonds are broken. The change is a \textbf{physical change}. In the oxygen example below, the reaction is shown to be reversible because oxygen is only partially soluble in water and comes out of solution very easily.\par 
        \label{m38720*id339165}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
          
    \begin{equation}
    {C}_{2}{H}_{5}\mathrm{OH}\left(l\right)\to {C}_{2}{H}_{5}\mathrm{OH}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\tag{17.7}
      \end{equation}
        \label{m38720*id339233}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
          
    \begin{equation}
    {O}_{2}\left(g\right)â‡Œ{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{aq}\right)\tag{17.8}
      \end{equation}
      \label{m38720*uid56}
            \subsubsection{ Factors that affect the conductivity of water}
            \nopagebreak
            \label{m38720*id339287}The conductivity of water is therefore affected by the following factors:\par 
        \label{m38720*id339291}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \label{m38720*uid57}\item The \textbf{type of substance} that dissolves in water.
Whether a material is a strong electrolyte (e.g. potassium nitrate, ${\mathrm{KNO}}_{3}$), a weak electrolyte (e.g. acetate, ${\mathrm{CH}}_{3}\mathrm{COOH}$) or a non-electrolyte (e.g. sugar, alcohol, oil) will affect the conductivity of water because the concentration of ions in solution will be different in each case.
\label{m38720*uid58}\item The \textbf{concentration of ions} in solution.
The higher the concentration of ions in solution, the higher its conductivity will be.
\label{m38720*uid59}\item \textbf{Temperature.}
The warmer the solution, the higher the solubility of the material being dissolved and therefore the higher the conductivity as well.

        \label{m38720*id339672}Remember that for electricity to flow, there needs to be a movement of charged particles e.g. ions. With the solid $\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystals, there was no flow of electricity recorded on the ammeter. Although the solid is made up of ions, they are held together very tightly within the crystal lattice and therefore no current will flow. Distilled water, benzene and alcohol also don't conduct a current because they are \textsl{covalent compounds} and therefore do not contain ions.\par 
        \label{m38720*id339687}The ammeter should have recorded a current when the salt solutions and the acid and base solutions were connected in the circuit. In solution, salts \textsl{dissociate} into their ions, so that these are free to move in the solution. Acids and bases behave in a similar way and dissociate to form hydronium and oxonium ions.

Solutions that contain free-moving ions are able to conduct electricity because of the movement of charged particles. Solutions that do not contain free-moving ions do not conduct electricity.

\Ifact{Conductivity in streams and rivers is affected by the geology of the area where the water is flowing through. Streams that run through areas with granite bedrock tend to have lower conductivity because granite is made of materials that do not ionise when washed into the water. On the other hand, streams that run through areas with clay soils tend to have higher conductivity because the materials ionise when they are washed into the water. Pollution can also affect conductivity. A failing sewage system or an inflow of fertiliser runoff would raise the conductivity because of the presence of chloride, phosphate, and nitrate ions, while an oil spill (non-ionic) would lower the conductivity. It is very important that conductivity is kept within a certain acceptable range so that the organisms living in these water systems are able to survive.}

            \nopagebreak
            \label{m38719*uid2131}
	We will look at three types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions. These are precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions. Precipitation and acid-base reactions are sometimes called ion exchange reactions. Redox reactions are electron transfer reactions. It is important to remember the difference between these two types of reactions. In ion exchange reactions ions are exchanged, in electron transfer reactions electrons are transferred. These terms will be explained further in the following sections. 
      \par 
      \label{m38719*uid78332}
	Ion exchange reactions can be represented by:
	  \label{m38719*eid071534}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
	    
    \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{AB\left(aq\right)}+\mathrm{CD\left(aq\right)}\to \mathrm{AD}+\mathrm{CB}\tag{17.13}
      \end{equation}
	  Either $\mathrm{AD}$ or $\mathrm{CB}$ may be a solid or a gas. When a solid forms this is known as a precipitation reaction. If a gas is formed then this may be called a gas forming reaction. Acid-base reactions are a special class of ion exchange reactions and we will look at them seperately. 
      \par 
      \label{m38719*eip-179}The formation of a precipitate or a gas helps to make the reaction happen. We say that the reaction is driven by the formation of a precipitate or a gas. All chemical reactions will only take place if there is something to make them happen. For some reactions this happens easily and for others it is harder to make the reaction occur.  \par

\Ifact{Ion exchange reactions are used in ion exchange chromatography. Ion exchange chromatography is used to purify water and as a means of softening water. Often when chemists talk about ion exchange, they mean ion exchange chromatography. }

      \label{m38719*id340106}It is important to understand what happened in the previous demonstration. We will look at what happens in each reaction, step by step.\par

When these compounds react, a number of ions are present in solution: ${\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}$, ${\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$, ${\mathrm{Na}}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$.
Because there are lots of ions in solution, they will collide with each other and may recombine in different ways. The product that forms may be insoluble, in which case a precipitate will form, or the product will be soluble, in which case the ions will go back into solution. Let's see how the ions in this example could have combined with each other:
\label{m38719*id753}\nopagebreak\noindent{}

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\to {\mathrm{CuCO}}_{3}\tag{17.14}
      \end{equation}
\label{m38719*id7546}\nopagebreak\noindent{}

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+2{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\to {\mathrm{CuCl}}_{2}\tag{17.15}
      \end{equation}
\label{m38719*id7866}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\to \mathrm{NaCl}\tag{17.16}
      \end{equation}
\label{m38719*id76576}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    2{\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\to {\mathrm{Na}}_{2}{\mathrm{CO}}_{3}\tag{17.17}
      \end{equation}
You can automatically exclude the reactions where sodium carbonate and copper(II) chloride are the products because these were the initial reactants. You also know that sodium chloride ($\mathrm{NaCl}$) is soluble in water, so the remaining product (copper carbonate) must be the one that is insoluble. It is also possible to look up which salts are soluble and which are insoluble. If you do this, you will find that most carbonates are insoluble, therefore the precipitate that forms in this reaction must be ${\mathrm{CuCO}}_{3}$. The reaction that has taken place between the ions in solution is as follows:
\label{m38719*id7543}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    2{\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+{\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+2{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\to {\mathrm{CuCO}}_{3}+2{\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+2{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\tag{17.18}
      \end{equation}
    \label{m38719*uid68}\item \textbf{Reaction 2:} Sodium sulphate reacts with copper(II) chloride.\newline
The ions that are present in solution are ${\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}$, ${\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}$, ${\mathrm{Na}}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$.
The ions collide with each other and may recombine in different ways. The possible combinations of the ions are as follows:
\label{m38719*id763}\nopagebreak\noindent{}

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\to {\mathrm{CuSO}}_{4}\tag{17.19}
      \end{equation}
\label{m38719*id75876}\nopagebreak\noindent{}

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+2{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\to {\mathrm{CuCl}}_{2}\tag{17.20}
      \end{equation}
\label{m38719*id75745}\nopagebreak\noindent{}

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\to \mathrm{NaCl}\tag{17.21}
      \end{equation}
\label{m38719*id75775}\nopagebreak\noindent{}

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\to {\mathrm{Na}}_{2}{\mathrm{SO}}_{4}\tag{17.22}
      \end{equation}
If we look up which of these salts are soluble and which are insoluble, we see that most chlorides and most sulphates are soluble. This is why no precipitate forms in this second reaction. Even when the ions recombine, they immediately separate and go back into solution. The reaction that has taken place between the ions in solution is as follows:
\label{m38719*id74443}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    2{\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}+{\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+2{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\to 2{\mathrm{Na}}^{+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}+{\mathrm{Cu}}^{2+}+2{\mathrm{Cl}}^{-}\tag{17.23}

            \subsubsection{ Other reactions in aqueous solutions}
            \nopagebreak
\label{m38719*id08212}
There are many types of reactions that can occur in aqueous solutions. In this section we will look at two of them: acid-base reactions and redox reactions. These reactions will be covered in more detail in Grade 11. 
\par 
\label{m38719*eip-329}
            \subsubsection{ Acid-base reactions}
            \nopagebreak
\label{m38719*id0821354}Acid base reactions take place between acids and bases. In general, the products will be water and a salt (i.e. an ionic compound). An example of this type of reaction is: \label{m38719*eid1534}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
	    
    \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{NaOH\left(aq\right)}+\mathrm{HCl\left(aq\right)}\to \mathrm{NaCl\left(aq\right)}+{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O\; \left(l\right)}\tag{17.26}
      \end{equation}
\par \label{m38719*eip-588}This is an special case of an ion exchange reaction since the sodium in the sodium hydroxide swaps places with the hydrogen in the hydrogen chloride forming sodium chloride. At the same time the hydroxide and the hydrogen combine to form water. \par 
\label{m38719*eip-454}
            \subsubsection{ Redox reactions}
            \nopagebreak
            \label{m38719*eip-585}Redox reactions involve the exchange of electrons. One ion loses electrons and becomes more positive, while the other ion gains electrons and becomes more negative. To decide if a redox reaction has occurred we look at the charge of the atoms, ions or molecules involved. If one of them has become more positive and the other one has become more negative then a redox reaction has occurred. For example, sodium metal is oxidised to form sodium oxide (and sometimes sodium peroxide as well). The balanced equation for this is:
\label{m38719*id624}\nopagebreak\noindent{}
    \begin{equation}
    4\mathrm{Na}+{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\to 2{Na}_{2}{O}\tag{17.27}
      \end{equation}
\par \label{m38719*eip-815}In the above reaction sodium and oxygen are both neutral and so have no charge. In the products however, the sodium atom has a charge of $+1$ and the oxygen atom has a charge of $-2$. This tells us that the sodium has lost electrons and the oxygen has gained electrons. Since one species has become more positive and one more negative we can conclude that a redox reaction has occurred. We could also say that electrons have been transferred from one species to the other. (In this case the electrons were transferred from the sodium to the oxygen).\par \label{m38719*eip-878}
            \begin{g_experiment}{Demonstration: Oxidation of sodium metal}
            \nopagebreak
            \label{m38719*eip-355}
You will need a bunsen burner, a small piece of sodium metal and a metal spatula. Light the bunsen burner. Place the sodium metal on the spatula. Place the sodium in the flame. When the reaction finishes, you should observe a white powder on the spatula. This is a mixture of sodium oxide (${Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$) and sodium peroxide (${Na}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{2}$). 
\par \label{m38719*eip-980}
      \Warning{Sodium metal is very reactive. Sodium metal reacts vigourously with water and should never be placed in water. Be very careful when handling sodium metal.}

            \label{m38719*eip-190}\noindent{}\textbf{Aim: }\newline
    To use experiments to determine what type of reaction occurs.
\par 
\label{m38719*eip-1901}\noindent{}\textbf{Apparatus: }\newline
    Soluble salts (e.g. potassium nitrate, ammonium chloride, sodium carbonate, silver nitrate, sodium bromide); hydrochloric acid ($\mathrm{HCl}$); sodium hydroxide($\mathrm{NaOH}$); bromothymol blue; zinc metal; copper (II) sulphate; beakers; test-tubes
\par 
\label{m38719*eip-1902}\noindent{}\textbf{Method: }\label{m38719*id6231}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item For each of the salts, dissolve a small amount in water and observe what happens.\item Try dissolving pairs of salts (e.g. potassium nitrate and sodium carbonate) in water and observe what happens.\item Dissolve some sodium carbonate in hydrochloric acid and observe what happens.\item Carefully measure out $20{\mathrm{cm}}^{3}$ of sodium hydroxide into a beaker. \item Add some bromothymol blue to the sodium hydroxide\item Carefully add a few drops of hydrochloric acid to the sodium hydroxide and swirl. Repeat until you notice the colour change.\item Place the zinc metal into the copper sulphate solution and observe what happens.\end{itemize}
\par 
\label{m38719*eip-1903}\noindent{}\textbf{Results: }\newline
    Answer the following questions:
\label{m38719*id6144}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item What did you observe when you dissolved each of the salts in water?\item What did you observe when you dissolved pairs of salts in the water?\item What did you observe when you dissolved sodium carbonate in hydrochloric acid?\item Why do you think we used bromothymol blue when mixing the hydrochloric acid and the sodium hydroxide? Think about the kind of reaction that occurred.\item What did you observe when you placed the zinc metal into the copper sulphate?\item Classify each reaction as either precipitation, gas forming, acid-base or redox.\item What makes each reaction happen (i.e. what is the driving force)? Is it the formation of a precipitate or something else?\item What criteria would you use to determine what kind of reaction occurs?\item Try to write balanced chemical equations for each reaction\end{itemize}
        \par 
\label{m38719*eip-1904}\noindent{}\textbf{Conclusion: }\newline
    We can see how we can classify reactions by performing experiments. 
\par 
\end{g_experiment}
\label{m38719*eip-761}In the experiment above, you should have seen how each reaction type differs from the others. For example, a gas forming reaction leads to bubbles in the solution, a precipitation reaction leads to a precipitate forming, an acid-base reaction can be seen by adding a suitable indicator and a redox reaction can be seen by one metal disappearing and a deposit forming in the solution.\par

            \label{m38719*uid95}\item The \textbf{polar} nature of water means that \textbf{ionic compounds} dissociate easily in aqueous solution into their component ions.
\label{m38719*uid96}\item \textbf{Ions} in solution play a number of roles. In the human body for example, ions help to regulate the internal environment (e.g. controlling muscle function, regulating blood pH). Ions in solution also determine water hardness and pH.
\label{m38719*uid97}\item \textbf{Water hardness} is a measure of the mineral content of water. Hard water has a high mineral concentration and generally also a high concentration of metal ions e.g. calcium and magnesium. The opposite is true for soft water.
\label{m38719*uid100}\item \textbf{Conductivity} is a measure of a solution's ability to conduct an electric current.
\label{m38719*uid101}\item An \textbf{electrolyte} is a substance that contains free ions and is therefore able to conduct an electric current. Electrolytes can be divided into \textbf{strong} and \textbf{weak} electrolytes, based on the extent to which the substance ionises in solution.
\label{m38719*uid102}\item A \textbf{non-electrolyte} cannot conduct an electric current because it dooes not contain free ions.
\label{m38719*uid103}\item The \textbf{type of substance}, the \textbf{concentration of ions} and the \textbf{temperature} of the solution affect its conductivity.
\label{m38719*uid0253}\item There are three main types of reactions that occur in aqueous solutions. These are precipitation reactions, acid-base reactions and redox reactions.
\label{m38719*uid8923}\item 
Precipitation and acid-base reactions are sometimes known as ion exchange reactions. Ion exchange reactions also include gas forming reactions.
\label{m38719*uid104}\item A \textbf{precipitate} is formed when ions in solution react with each other to form an insoluble product. Solubility 'rules' help to identify the precipitate that has been formed.
\label{m38719*uid105}\item A number of tests can be used to identify whether certain \textbf{anions} are present in a solution.
\label{m38719*id813}\item An acid-base reaction is one in which an acid reacts with a base to form a salt and water.
\label{m38719*uid823}\item A redox reaction is one in which electrons are transferred from one substance to another.
