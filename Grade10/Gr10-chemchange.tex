      \label{m38721*id62175}As we have already mentioned, a number of changes can occur when elements react with one another. These changes may either be \textsl{physical} or \textsl{chemical}. One way of representing these changes is through \textbf{balanced chemical equations}. A chemical equation describes a chemical reaction by using symbols for the elements involved. For example, if we look at the reaction between iron ($\mathrm{Fe}$) and sulphur ($\mathrm{S}$) to form iron sulphide ($\mathrm{FeS}$), we could represent these changes either in words or using chemical symbols:\par 
      \label{m38721*id62197}$\mathrm{iron}+\mathrm{sulphur}\to \mathrm{iron\; sulphide}$\par 
      \label{m38721*id62550}or\par 
      \label{m38721*id62555}
        $Fe+\mathrm{S}\to \mathrm{FeS}$
      \par 
      \label{m38721*id62582}Another example would be:\par 
      \label{m38721*id62585}$\mathrm{ammonia}+\mathrm{oxygen}\to \mathrm{nitric\; oxide}+\mathrm{water}$\par 
      \label{m38721*id62598}or\par 
      \label{m38721*id62603}$4{\mathrm{NH}}_{3}+5{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\to 4\mathrm{NO}+6{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$
      \par 
      \label{m38721*id62659}Compounds on the left of the arrow are called the \textbf{reactants} and these are needed for the reaction to take place. In this equation, the reactants are ammonia and oxygen. The compounds on the right are called the \textbf{products} and these are what is formed from the reaction.\par 
      \label{m38721*id62675}In order to be able to write a balanced chemical equation, there are a number of important things that need to be done:\par 
      \label{m38721*id62681}\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{\arabic*}. ] 
            \label{m38721*uid1}\item Know the chemical symbols for the elements involved in the reaction
\label{m38721*uid2}\item Be able to write the chemical formulae for different reactants and products
\label{m38721*uid3}\item Balance chemical equations by understanding the laws that govern chemical change
\label{m38721*uid4}\item Know the state symbols for the equation
\end{enumerate}
      \label{m38721*id62733}We will look at each of these steps separately in the next sections.\par 
    \label{m38721*cid2}
            \subsection*{Chemical symbols}
            \nopagebreak
      \label{m38721*id62746}It is very important to know the chemical symbols for common elements in the Periodic Table, so that you are able to write chemical equations and to recognise different compounds.\par

      \label{m38721*id62763}\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \label{m38721*uid5}\item Write down the chemical symbols and names of all the elements that you know.
\label{m38721*uid6}\item Compare your list with another learner and add any symbols and names that you don't have.
\label{m38721*uid7}\item Spend some time, either in class or at home, learning the symbols for at least the first twenty elements in the periodic table. You should also learn the symbols for other common elements that are not in the first twenty.
\label{m38721*uid8}\item Write a short test for someone else in the class and then exchange tests with them so that you each have the chance to answer one.

%             \subsection*{Writing chemical formulae}
%             \nopagebreak
%       \label{m38721*id62835}A \textbf{chemical formula} is a concise way of giving information about the atoms that make up a particular chemical compound. A chemical formula shows each element by its symbol and also shows how many atoms of each element are found in that compound. The number of atoms (if greater than one) is shown as a subscript.\par 
%       \label{m38721*id62111}\noindent{}\textbf{Examples:}
%         \textbf{${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$} (methane)\par 
%       \label{m38721*id63054}Number of atoms: $\left(1\ensuremath{\times}\mathrm{carbon}\right)+\left(4\ensuremath{\times}\mathrm{hydrogen}\right)=5$ atoms in one methane molecule\par 
%       \label{m38721*id63058}\textbf{${\mathrm{H}}_{2}{\mathrm{SO}}_{4}$} (sulphuric acid)\par 
%       \label{m38721*id63091}Number of atoms: $\left(2\ensuremath{\times}\mathrm{hydrogen}\right)+\left(1\ensuremath{\times}\mathrm{sulphur}\right)+\left(4\ensuremath{\times}\mathrm{oxygen}\right)=7$ atoms in one molecule of sulphuric acid\par 
%       \label{m38721*id63095}A chemical formula may also give information about how the atoms are arranged in a molecule if it is written in a particular way. A molecule of ethane, for example, has the chemical formula ${\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}$. This formula tells us how many atoms of each element are in the molecule, but doesn't tell us anything about how these atoms are arranged. In fact, each carbon atom in the ethane molecule is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. Another way of writing the formula for ethane is ${\mathrm{CH}}_{3}{\mathrm{CH}}_{3}$. The number of atoms of each element has not changed, but this formula gives us more information about how the atoms are arranged in relation to each other.\par 
%       \label{m38721*id63154}The slightly tricky part of writing chemical formulae comes when you have to work out the ratio in which the elements combine. For example, you may know that sodium ($\mathrm{Na}$) and chlorine ($\mathrm{Cl}$) react to form sodium chloride, but how do you know that in each molecule of sodium chloride there is only \textsl{one} atom of sodium for every \textsl{one} atom of chlorine? It all comes down to the \textbf{valency} of an atom or group of atoms. Valency is the number of bonds that an element can form with another element. Working out the chemical formulae of chemical compounds using their valency, will be covered in Grade 11. For now, we will use formulae that you already know.\par

            \nopagebreak
        \label{m38726*id63198}In order to balance a chemical equation, it is important to understand the law of conservation of mass.\par 
\label{m38726*fhsst!!!underscore!!!id145}
\Definition{   \label{id2463440}The law of conservation of mass } { \label{m38726*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id145}
        \label{m38726*id63208}The mass of a closed system of substances will remain constant, regardless of the processes acting inside the system. Matter can change form, but cannot be created or destroyed. For any chemical process in a closed system, the mass of the reactants must equal the mass of the products. \par 
         } 
        \label{m38726*id63221}In a chemical equation then, the \textbf{mass} of the reactants must be equal to the mass of the products. In order to make sure that this is the case, the number of \textbf{atoms} of each element in the reactants must be equal to the number of atoms of those same elements in the products. Some examples are shown below:\par 
        \label{m38726*id63238}

        \label{m38726*id63649}We now need to find a way to balance those equations that are not balanced so that the number of atoms of each element in the reactants is the same as that for the products. This can be done by changing the \textbf{coefficients} of the molecules until the atoms on each side of the arrow are balanced. You will see later that these coefficients tell us something about the \textbf{mole ratio} in which substances react. They also tell us about the volume relationship between gases in the reactants and products.\par

\Tip{Coefficients \\
        \label{m38726*id63674}Remember that if you put a number in front of a molecule, that number applies to the \textsl{whole} molecule. For example, if you write $2\mathrm{H}{}_{2}\mathrm{O}$, this means that there are 2 molecules of water. In other words, there are 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. If we write $3\mathrm{HCl}$, this means that there are 3 molecules of $\mathrm{HCl}$. In other words there are 3 hydrogen atoms and 3 chlorine atoms in total. In the first example, 2 is the coefficient and in the second example, 3 is the coefficient.\par }

\label{m38726*eip-69823}We will try to balance the following equation:

    \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Al}+{\mathrm{O}}_{2}\to {\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}\tag{13.4}
      \end{equation}
Take 1 ball of one colour. This represents a molecule of $Al$. Take two balls of another colour and stick them together. This represents a molecule of ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$. Place these molecules on your left. Now take two balls of one colour and three balls of another colour to form a molecule of ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$. Place these molecules on your right. On a piece of paper draw coloured circles to represent the balls. Draw a line down the center of the paper to represent the molecules on the left and on the right. 
\par 
\label{m38726*id23534}
Count the number of balls on the left and the number on the right. Do you have the same number of each colour on both sides? If not the equation is not balanced. How many balls will you have to add to each side to make the number of balls the same? How would you add these balls?
\par 
\label{m38726*id09873432}You should find that you need 4 balls of one colour for $\mathrm{Al}$ and 3 pairs of balls of another colour (i.e. 6 balls in total) for ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ on the left side. On the right side you should find that you need 2 clusters of balls for ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$.

\label{m38726*uid14}\item STEP 4: If the equation is not balanced, change the coefficients of the molecules until the number of atoms of each element on either side of the equation balance.
\label{m38726*uid15}\item STEP 5: Check that the atoms are in fact balanced.
\label{m38726*uid16}\item STEP 6 (we will look at this a little later): Add any extra details to the equation e.g. phase.

{\westep{Balance the equation}
The equation is not balanced since there are 2 chlorine atoms in the product and only 1 in the reactants. If we add a coefficient of 2 to the HCl to increase the number of H and Cl atoms in the reactants, the equation will look like this:
\begin{center}
\rm${Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_{2} + H_{2}}$\\

{\westep{Check that the atoms are balanced}
If we count the atoms on each side of the equation, we find the following:

Products: Mg = 1; H = 2; Cl = 2

The equation is balanced. The final equation is:

Reactants: C = 1; H = 4; O = 2

Products: C = 1; H = 2; O = 3\\
}

{\westep{Balance the equation}

If we add a coefficient of 2 to H$_{2}$O, then the number of hydrogen atoms in the reactants will be 4, which is the same as for the reactants. The equation will be:

\begin{center}
\rm${CH_{4} + O_{2} \rightarrow CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O}$\\
\end{center}
}

{\westep{Check that the atoms balance}

Reactants: C = 1; H = 4; O = 2

Products: C = 1; H = 4; O = 4

You will see that, although the number of \textit{hydrogen} atoms now balances, there are more oxygen atoms in the products. You now need to repeat the previous step. If we put a coefficient of 2 in front of O$_{2}$, then we will increase the number of oxygen atoms in the reactants by 2. The new equation is:

\begin{center}
\rm${CH_{4} + 2O_{2} \rightarrow CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O}$
\end{center}

When we check the number of atoms again, we find that the number of atoms of each element in the reactants is the same as the number in the products. The equation is now balanced.

{\westep{Balance the equation}
With a complex equation, it is always best to start with atoms that appear only once on each side i.e. Na, N and S atoms. Since the S atoms already balance, we will start with Na and N atoms. There are two Na atoms on the right and one on the left. We will add a second Na atom by giving NaOH a coefficient of two. There are two N atoms on the left and one on the right. To balance the N atoms, NH$_{3}$ will be given a coefficient of two. The equation now looks as follows:

\begin{center}
\rm${(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} + 2NaOH \rightarrow 2NH_{3} + H_{2}O + Na_{2}SO_{4}}$\\

{\westep{Check that all atoms balance}
N, Na and S atoms balance, but O and H atoms do not. There are six O atoms and ten H atoms on the left, and five O atoms and eight H atoms on the right. We need to add one O atom and two H atoms on the right to balance the equation. This is done by adding another H$_{2}$O molecule on the right hand side. We now need to check the equation again:

\begin{center}
\rm${(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4} + 2NaOH \rightarrow 2NH_{3} + 2H_{2}O + Na_{2}SO_{4}}$\\
