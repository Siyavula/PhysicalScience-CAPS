      \label{m38120*id307092}We have now seen that different materials have 
different properties. Some materials are metals and some are non-metals; some 
are electrical or thermal conductors, while others are not. Depending on the 
properties of these materials, they can be used in lots of useful applications. 
But what is it exactly that makes up these materials? In other words, if we were 
to break down a material into the parts that make it up, what would we find? And 
how is it that a material's microscopic structure (the small parts that make up 
the material) is able to give it all these different properties?\par 
      \label{m38120*id307099}The answer lies in the smallest building block of 
matter: the \textbf{atom}. It is the \textsl{type} of atoms, and the way in which they are 
\textsl{arranged} in a material, that affects the 
properties of that substance. This is similar to building materials. We can use bricks, steel, cement, wood, straw (thatch), mud and many other things to build structures from. In the same way that the choice of building material affects the properties of the structure, so the atoms that make up matter affect the properties of matter.\par 
      \label{m38120*id307459}It is not often that substances are found in atomic 
form (just as you seldom find a building or structure made from one building material). Normally, atoms are bonded (joined) to other atoms to form \textbf{compounds} or \textbf{molecules}. It is only in the \textsl{noble gases} (e.g. helium, neon and argon) that atoms 
are found individually and are not bonded to other atoms. We looked at some of the 
reasons for this in earlier chapters.\par

\Definition{   \label{id2456442}\textbf{ Compound }} { \label{m38120*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id74}
      A compound is a group of two or more different atoms that are 
attracted to each other by relatively strong forces or bonds. 
       } 
Almost everything around us is made up of compounds. The only substances that do not exist as compounds are the noble gases. They exist as individual atoms. Compounds are formed when two or more atoms combine in fixed proportions. Compounds can be divided into \textbf{molecular compounds} (molecules), \textbf{ionic compounds} (salts) and \textbf{metallic compounds} (metals).
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item \textbf{Molecular compounds} form as a result of covalent bonding where electrons are shared between non-metal atoms.
\item \textbf{Ionic compounds} form as a result of ionic bonding where electrons are transferred from metals to non-metals. 
\item \textbf{Metals} are formed as a result of metallic bonding where metal atoms lose their outer electrons to form a lattice of regularly spaced positive ions and a 'pool' of delocalized electrons that surround the positive ions. 
\end{itemize}
The following diagram illustrates how compounds can be subdivided by the type of bonding.

Compounds can also be divided based on their structure. Relatively small molecules are called \textbf{covalent molecular structures}. These exist and interact as seperate molecules. Oxygen ($\mathsf{O}_{2}$), water ($\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{O}$), octane ($\mathsf{C}_{8}\mathsf{H}_{18}$), sulphur ($\mathsf{S}_{8}$) and buckminsterfullerene ($\mathsf{C}_{60}$, buckyballs) are all examples of covalent molecular structures. \\
Compounds that exist as giant repeating lattice structures ae called network structures. Examples include covalent molecules such as diamond, graphite and silica. Ionic substances are also network structures, for example a sodium chloride crystal is a huge lattice of repeating units made of sodium and chloride ions. All substances formed as a result of ionic bonding are network structures. Metals exist as large continuous lattice structures and are also classified as network structures. For example copper, zinc and iron can be seen as a giant crystals and are therefore considered to be network strucutres.
            \subsection*{Representing molecules}
            \nopagebreak
        \label{m38120*id307557}The structure of a molecule can be shown in many 
different ways. Sometimes it is easiest to show what a molecule looks like by 
using different types of \textbf{diagrams}, but at 
other times, we may decide to simply represent a molecule using its \textbf{chemical formula} or its written name.\par 
        \label{m38120*id307573}\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{\arabic*}. ] 
            \label{m38120*uid2}\item \textbf{Using formulae to show the structure of a 
molecule.}
A \textbf{chemical formula} is an abbreviated 
(shortened) way of describing a molecule, or some other chemical substance. In 
the chapter on classification of matter, we saw how chemical compounds can be 
represented using element symbols from the Periodic Table. A chemical formula 
can also tell us the \textsl{number} of atoms of 
each element that are in a molecule and their \textsl{ratio} in that molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for a molecule of carbon dioxide is
${\mathsf{CO}}_{2}$
The formula above is called the \textbf{molecular 
formula} of that compound. The formula tells us that in one molecule 
of carbon dioxide, there is one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen. The 
ratio of carbon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1:2.
\vspace{\rubberspace}\par
        \label{m38120*fhsst!!!underscore!!!id87}
 \Definition{   \label{id2456697}\textbf{ Molecular formula }} { \label{m38120*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id87}
This is a concise way of expressing information about the atoms that make up a 
particular chemical compound. The molecular formula gives the exact number of 
each type of atom in the molecule. 
 } 

A molecule of glucose has the molecular formula:
${\mathsf{C}}_{6}{\mathsf{H}}_{12}{\mathsf{O}}_{6}$.
In each glucose molecule, there are six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and 
six oxygen atoms. The ratio of carbon:hydrogen:oxygen is 6:12:6. We can simplify 
this ratio to write 1:2:1 (this means that for every one carbon atom there must be two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom), or if we were to use the element symbols, the formula 
would be written as ${\mathsf{CH}}_{2}\mathsf{O}$. This is called the \textbf{empirical formula} of the molecule.
\vspace{\rubberspace}\par
        \label{m38120*fhsst!!!underscore!!!id93}
\Definition{   \label{id2456770}\textbf{ Empirical formula }} { \label{m38120*meaningfhsst!!!underscore!!!id93}
This is a way of expressing the \textsl{relative} 
number of each type of atom in a chemical compound. In most cases, the empirical 
formula does not show the exact number of atoms, but rather the simplest 
\textsl{ratio} of the atoms in the compound. 
 } 

The empirical formula is useful when we want to write the formula for \textsl{network structures}. Since network structures may consist of millions of atoms, it is impossible to say exactly how many atoms are in each unit. It makes sense then to represent these units using their empirical formula. So, in the case of a metal such as copper, we would simply write $\mathsf{Cu}$, or if we were to represent a molecule of sodium chloride, we would simply write $\mathsf{NaCl}$. Chemical formulae therefore tell us something about the \textsl{types} of atoms that are in a compound and the \textsl{ratio} in which these atoms occur in the compound, but they don't give us any idea of what the molecule actually looks like, in other words its \textsl{shape}. To show the shape of compounds we can use diagrams. Another type of formula that can be used to describe a compound is its \textbf{structural formula}. A structural formula uses a graphical representation to show a compound's structure

\label{m38120*uid4}\item \textbf{Using diagrams to show the 
structure of a molecule}
Diagrams of molecules are very useful because they help us to picture how the 
atoms are arranged in the molecule and they help us to see the shape of the 
molecule. There are two types of diagrams that are commonly used:

            \label{m38120*uid5}\item 
\textsl{Ball and stick models}
This is a 3-dimensional molecular model that uses 'balls' to represent atoms and 
'sticks' to represent the bonds between them. The centres of the atoms (the 
balls) are connected by straight lines which represent the bonds between them. A 
simplified example is shown in Figure~11.2.

Figure \ref{fig:microscopic:diamond} shows the bonds between the carbon atoms in diamond, 
which is a \textbf{giant molecule}. Each carbon atom 
is joined to four others, and this pattern repeats itself until a complex 
\textsl{lattice} structure is formed. Each black 
ball in the diagram represents a carbon atom, and each line represents the bond 
between two carbon atoms. Note that the carbon atoms on the edges are actually 
bonded to four carbon atoms, but some of these carbon atoms have been omitted.

\Ifact{Diamonds are most often thought of in terms of their use in the 
jewellery industry. However, about 80\% of mined diamonds are unsuitable for use 
as gemstones and are therefore used in industry because of their strength and 
hardness. These properties of diamonds are due to the strong covalent bonds 
(covalent bonding will be explained later) between the carbon atoms in diamond. 
The most common uses for diamonds in industry are in cutting, drilling, 
grinding, and polishing.}
